## Description
I created an interesting yet simple bubble game. Here you have a hit counter, a timer of 60 seconds, and a score that starts at 0. Whenever you click or hit the correct bubble, your score increases by 10. The game continues for 60 seconds, and you can keep increasing your score by hitting the correct bubble.

## How to Play
1. Start the game.
2. Click on the correct bubble to score points.
3. Each correct hit increases your score by 10.
4. The game lasts for 60 seconds.
5. Try to get the highest score possible within the time limit.

## Features
- **Hit Counter:** Tracks the number of correct hits.
- **Timer:** A 60-second countdown timer.
- **Score:** Starts at 0 and increases by 10 with each correct hit.
