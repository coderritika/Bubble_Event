I made a Bubble_game using HTML, CSS, Javascript in this game we have hit, timer, Score, Now we set a timer of 60sec so that evrytime we click the bubble and if it matches with the hit's value then
our score gets increased by 10 till 60 sec. Once the timer reaches 0 it will display Game Over. 
In Javascript I have used DOM concept such as setInterval, querySelector, EventListener.
